                        League of Legends is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published
                        by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's
                        founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October
                        2009, the game has been free-to-play, and is monetized through purchasable character
                        customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

                        In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, with each team
                        occupying and defending their own half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character,
                        known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match,
                        champions become more powerful by collecting experience points and purchasing items in order to
                        defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing
                        through to the enemy base and destroying their "nexus", a large structure located within it.

                            The Ruined King is one of the most iconic figures in League history. But that’s just it—he’s
                            history. Viego’s life and the events that led to the Ruination happened 1,000 years ago, and
                            although its effects are still felt throughout Runeterra, it was never anything more than an
                            unfortunate chapter in the world’s history... Until now.

                            “After I finished Senna, our lead producer Ryan ‘Reav3’ Mireles made an offhand comment
                            about how players seem to enjoy lore connections between champions, especially if they’ve
                            heard about them for a while. Players loved seeing Senna, Lucian, and Thresh’s stories move
                            forward,” recalls champion designer August “August” Browning. “I joked that we should make
                            the Ruined King next to finish that storyline, and he looked at me and said, ‘That’s an
                            amazing idea. That’s your next champion.’”

                            “Working on Viego was particularly interesting because he lived 1,000 years in the past in a
                            nation that doesn’t exist in Runeterra. So that meant we needed to create an entire
                            civilization in addition to Viego” explains narrative lead Jared “Carnival Knights” Rosen.

                        <p>Riot Games, which owns League of Legends, commissioned the winner's trophy known as the
                            Summoner's Cup. Riot specified that it should weigh 70 pounds, though the actual weight of
                            the finished cup was reduced so it would not be too heavy to lift in victory. Thomas Lyte,

                            trophy for the 2014 games.[14]
